            <h4>Advisor: Dr. Rudolph Hon</h4>
            <p><b>Abstract: </b>The application of road de-icers has lead to increasing solute 
            concentrations in surface and ground water across the northern US, Canada, and northern
             Europe. In a public water supply well field in southeastern Massachusetts, USA, 
             chloride concentrations in ground water from an unconfined aquifer have steadily 
             risen for the past twenty years. The objectives of this study are to understand 
             spatial and temporal trends in road salt concentrations in order to identify 
             contamination sources and fate. To this end, the methods of this project include field 
             and lab work. Water samples were collected from surface, near-surface, and ground water 
             from March 2012 to March 2013. The other major field data are specific conductance 
             measurements from probes located in three piezometers. In the lab, all samples were 
             analyzed for major ions with ion chromatography analysis. Additionally, trace elements 
             were measured by inductively coupled plasma analysis on a subset of samples. The results 
             of these hydrogeochemical procedures showed several important trends. First, the highest 
             concentrations of sodium and chloride from near-surface samples were located near to 
             roadways. Second, ground water samples taken from glacial sediments contained relatively 
             high concentrations throughout the water column, whereas ground water samples from 
             wetlands had high concentrations only near the surface. Third, there was no clear 
             relationship between pH and cation concentrations. Finally, specific conductance data 
             showed strong seasonal trends near to the surface, whereas values taken from deeper in 
             the aquifer were steadily increasing. Based on these results, it is highly probable that 
             road salt application is the dominate contamination source. The pathways of road salt in
              the watershed include runoff into surface water and infiltration into the vadose zone 
              and ground water. Road salt appears to preferentially travel through glacial features 
              rather than floodplain features. It is possible that sodium from road salt is sorbed to 
              aquifer sediment and displaces other cations. However, the low values of trace metals 
              suggest that cation exchange is not mobilizing heavy metals. Finally, the increasing 
              specific conductance values deep in the aquifer suggest that road salt is retained 
              within the aquifer and concentrations will likely increase in the future if the current
               road salt application procedures are continued.</p>
